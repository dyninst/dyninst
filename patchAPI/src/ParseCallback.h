/* PatchAPI uses the ParseAPI CFG to construct its own CFG, which
   means that we need to be notified of any changes in the underlying
   CFG. These changes can come from a number of sources, including
   the PatchAPI modification interface or a self-modifying binary.

   The PatchAPI modification chain looks like the following:
   1) User requests PatchAPI to modify the CFG;
   2) PatchAPI makes the corresponding request to ParseAPI;
   3) ParseAPI modifies its CFG, triggering "modified CFG" callbacks;
   4) PatchAPI hooks these callbacks and updates its structures.

   This is much easier than PatchAPI modifying them a priori, because
   it allows for self-modifying code (which skips step 2) to work
   with the exact same chain of events.
