// vectorSet.h
// A container class for a set of objects providing just a few operations
// (but doing so _very_ efficiently, in space and time):
// 1) add an item
// 2) remove an arbitrary item from the set and return its contents
// 3) peek at individual items in the set by their index (0 thru size-1)
// 4) remove an item by its index
