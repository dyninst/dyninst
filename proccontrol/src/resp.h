/**
 * The Resp class is a second implementation of the response
 * class.  On async systems, such as BlueGene, it tracks
 * command messages we've sent to the OS, and associates them
 * with the responses we receive from the OS.
 *
 * Resp has several improvements over response:
 * - Integrated support for multi-responses, where you
 *   get multiple responses from one message.
 * - Replacement of response's global lock with a
 *   per-process condition variable, which should have
 *   significantly less contention
 * - Templated parameters to hold command specific data.
 *
 * Over the long-term, it would be nice to completely replace
 * response with Resp, but for the moment Resp will just be used
 * for new code.
