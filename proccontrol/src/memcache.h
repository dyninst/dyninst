/**
 * DON'T USE THE MEMCACHE FOR ARBITRARY MEMORY OPERATIONS!
 *
 * This class is meant to assist the SysV parser and the
 * thread_db parser--where we're wrapping another library
 * that is not async aware.
 *
 * The semantics are such that this class expects that
 * reads and writes may be restarted, and will cache
 * and not redo operations it has already seen.  This
 * makes a difference when you do operations such as:
 *
 * write 'A' -> 0x1000
 * write 'B' -> 0x1000
 * write 'A' -> 0x1000
 *
 * Under this class 0x1000 will contain 'B' after these three
 * operations.  The second 'A' write would be detected to be a
 * duplicated of the first and dropped.  We really do want these
 * semantics if we're restarting operations (we expect a write 'B'
 * will follow the second write 'A'), but this is inappropriate
 * for general purpose use.
 *
 * Update - The memcache can now store registers.  Just what
 * every memcache needs.
