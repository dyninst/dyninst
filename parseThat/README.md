# parseThat

## Introduction

parseThat is an application that provides a rigorous and robust test of
DyninstAPI on arbitrary binaries.  Geared mainly for debugging purposes,
parseThat generates copious output for each dyninstAPI feature it uses.

These output logs can be used to quickly locate the source of parsing or
instrumentation bugs, in the rare instance when they occur.

## Build

parseThat is included as part of the Dyninst build.

## Running

Documentation on running parseThat is encoded within the binary itself.
It can be viewed by simply running parseThat with the --help flag.
