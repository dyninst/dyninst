/// The %InstructionDecoder class decodes instructions, given a buffer of bytes
/// and a length,
/// and constructs an %Instruction.
/// The %InstructionDecoder will, by default, be constructed to decode machine
/// language
/// on the platform on which it has been compiled.  The buffer
/// will be treated as if there is an instruction stream starting at the
/// beginning of the buffer.
/// %InstructionDecoder objects are given a buffer from which to decode at
/// construction.
/// Calls to \c decode will proceed to decode instructions sequentially from
/// that buffer until its
/// end is reached.  At that point, all subsequent calls to \c decode will
/// return an invalid
/// %Instruction object.
///
/// An %InstructionDecoder object may alternately be constructed without
/// designating a buffer,
/// and the buffer may be specified at the time \c decode is called.  This
/// method of use may be
/// more convenient for users who are decoding non-contiguous instructions.
