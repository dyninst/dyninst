 *
 * When analyzing and modifying binary code, it is necessary to translate
 * between raw binary instructions and an abstract form that describes the
semantics
 * of the instructions.
 * As a part of the %Dyninst project, we have developed the
 * %Instruction API, an API and library for decoding and representing
 * machine instructions in a platform-independent manner. The
 * %Instruction API includes methods for decoding machine language,
 * convenient abstractions for its analysis, and methods to produce disassembly
from those
 * abstractions. The current implementation supports the IA32,
 * AMD-64, POWER, and PowerPC instruction sets.  The %Instruction API
 * has the following basic capabilities:
 * - Decoding: interpreting a sequence of bytes as a machine instruction in a
given machine language.
 * - Abstract representation: representing the behavior of that instruction as
an abstract syntax tree.
 * - Disassembly: translating an abstract representation of a machine
instruction into a string
 * representation of the corresponding assembly language instruction.
 *
 * Our goal in designing the %Instruction API is to provide a representation of
machine
 * instructions that can be manipulated by higher-level algorithms with minimal
knowledge
 * of platform-specific details.  In addition, users who need platform-specific
information
 * should be able to access it.  To do so, we provide an interface that
disassembles a machine
 * instruction, extracts an operation and its operands, converts the operands to
abstract syntax trees,
 * and presents this to the user.  A user of the %Instruction API can work at a
level of abstraction slightly
 * higher than assembly language,
 * rather than working directly with machine language.  Additionally, by
converting the operands to abstract
 * syntax trees, we make it possible to analyze the operands in a uniform
manner, regardless of the
 * complexity involved in the operand's actual computation.
