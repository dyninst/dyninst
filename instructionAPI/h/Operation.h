/// the implicit register reads and writes, and the control flow behavior
/// of a particular assembly language operation.  It additionally provides
/// access to the assembly mnemonic, which allows any semantic details that
/// are not encoded in the %Instruction representation to be added by higher
/// layers of analysis.
///
/// As an example, the \c CMP operation on IA32/AMD64 processors has the
/// following
/// properties:
///   - %Operand 1 is read, but not written
///   - %Operand 2 is read, but not written
///   - The following flags are written:
///     - Overflow
///     - Sign
///     - Zero
///     - Parity
///     - Carry
///     - Auxiliary
///   - No other registers are read, and no implicit memory operations are
///   performed
///
/// %Operations are constructed by the %InstructionDecoder as part of the
/// process
/// of constructing an %Instruction.
