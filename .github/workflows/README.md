# GitHub CI testing Dyninst

Reading through the [overview](https://resources.github.com/devops/ci-cd/) of GitHub CI/CD is highly recommended. A [primer](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) on yaml may also be helpful. A brief overview of actions and workflows is provided at the bottom of this page.

## Known Issues

[build-opts](workflows/build-opts.yaml)
  - The 'stdlibs' job is disabled because Dyninst doesn't build with libc++ (#725).

[consumers](workflows/consumers.yaml)
  - The version of *must* has to be updated manually

[Pull Request tests](workflows/pr-tests.yaml)
  - The external tests can't be executed when built with clang because it doesn't work with libdyninstAPI_RT


## Actions

### Build Dyninst ([actions/build](actions/build/action.yaml))

*Builds a single configuration of Dyninst on one of the pre-built containers in the Dyninst container repo*

This just forwards its arguments on to one of the OS-specific build actions.

**Inputs**
- **os**
  The operating system to use
- **extra-cmake-flags**
  Additional flags passed directly to CMake
- **compiler**
  The compiler to use
- **compiler-version**
  The compiler's version
- **build-type**
  CMake build type to use. Default is `RELWITHDEBINFO`
- **install-dir**
  Where to install Dyninst
- **src-dir**
  Location of Dyninst source to build. Default is `/dyninst/src`
- **num-jobs**
  Number of CMake build jobs (i.e., `cmake --build --parallel N`). Default is 2
- **extra-libs**
  Additional libraries to install via the OS-specific package manager


### Build Fedora ([actions/build-fedora](actions/build-fedora/action.yaml))

*Builds a single configuration of Dyninst on one of the pre-built Fedora containers in the Dyninst container repo*

Only one version of gcc or clang is made available. This is because it is very difficult to get multiple versions of any compiler installed simultaneously on Fedora.

**Inputs**
- **extra-cmake-flags**
  Additional flags passed directly to CMake
- **compiler**
  The compiler to use
- **compiler-version**
  The compiler's version
- **build-type**
  CMake build type to use. Default is `RELWITHDEBINFO`
- **install-dir**
  Where to install Dyninst
- **src-dir**
  Location of Dyninst source to build. Default is `/dyninst/src`
- **num-jobs**
  Number of CMake build jobs (i.e., `cmake --build --parallel N`). Default is 2
- **extra-libs**
  Additional libraries to install via `yum`


### Build Ubuntu ([actions/build-ubuntu](actions/build-ubuntu/action.yaml))

*Builds a single configuration of Dyninst on one of the pre-built Ubuntu containers in the Dyninst container repo*

Clang-specific libraries are installed automatically. For example, `compiler: 'clang'` and `compiler-version: 15` will install `libomp-15-dev` and remove all other versions of `libomp`.

**Inputs**
- **extra-cmake-flags**
  Additional flags passed directly to CMake
- **compiler**
  The compiler to use
- **compiler-version**
  The compiler's version
- **build-type**
  CMake build type to use. Default is `RELWITHDEBINFO`
- **install-dir**
  Where to install Dyninst
- **src-dir**

  Number of CMake build jobs (i.e., `cmake --build --parallel N`). Default is 2
- **extra-libs**
  Additional libraries to install via `apt`


### CMake build types ([actions/build-types](actions/build-types/action.yaml))

*Returns the CMake build types used in CI*

**Outputs**
- **all**
  All build types used by Dyninst as a JSON array of strings

### Operating systems ([actions/os-versions](actions/os-versions/action.yaml))

*Returns the operating systems Dyninst is tested on*

**outputs**
- **all**
  All OS names as a JSON array of strings
- **latest**
  The most-recent supported version of each OS as a JSON array of strings

## Workflows

### Build options ([workflows/build-opts](workflows/build-opts.yaml))

*Builds Dyninst with different values for each of its CMake options*

Ensures that Dyninst builds on all supported platforms and compilers in non-standard configurations (e.g., disabling OpenMP), with different linkers, and different C++ standard libraries. `DYNINST_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` is enabled by default. The linkers used for `DYNINST_LINKER` are bfd, gold, mold, and lld.

**when**: Every Monday at 3AM CST, or manually

### CMake formatting ([workflows/cmake-formatting.yaml](workflows/cmake-formatting.yaml))

*Runs `cmake-format` on updated files*

Ensures modified CMake files are correctly formatted using `cmake-format` and the rules in `.cmake-format.yaml` in the root of the project.

**when**: on pull requests to the master branch when a CMake file is changed, or manually

### Build with many compilers ([workflows/compiler-multibuild](workflows/compiler-multibuild.yaml))

*Builds Dyninst with all supported versions of gcc and clang available on Ubuntu, the built-in versions of gcc and clang on Fedora, and the supported C++ standards*

This is a complex workflow that generates dozens of jobs. It is complicated by the fact that Fedora makes it very difficult to install multiple compiler versions simultaneously. In particular, it only offers one version of gcc and clang via 'yum'. Conversely, Ubuntu allows for arbitrary numbers and versions of compilers. This makes the parameter space large enough that it is easier to generate it using a python [script](scripts/compiler_configs.py). We only support Fedora since version 37, so the minimum versions of gcc and clang are 12 and 15, respectively. On Ubuntu, the minimum version is 7 for both.

**when**: Every Monday at 3AM CST, or manually

### Dyninst consumers ([workflows/consumers](workflows/consumers.yaml))

*Builds the latest version of applications that consume Dyninst*

All consumers are built against the latest development container using the latest version of each supported operating system. Some consumers are more easily built with Spack and some are easier to build from source.

Spack builds:
- [HPCToolkit](http://hpctoolkit.org/) development branch

  Substantial efforts are undertaken to reduce the number of libraries built by spack. This is because there are often timeouts in fetching sources when running from GitHub CI machines.


From-source builds:
- [Must](https://www.i12.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/nrbe) latest release

  They don't provide a public repository, so the tested version will need to be updated manually.
  
- [systemtap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/) development branch
- [STAT](https://hpc.llnl.gov/software/development-environment-software/stat-stack-trace-analysis-tool) development branch
- [TAU](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php) development branch
- [extrae](https://tools.bsc.es/extrae) development branch

**when**: Every Monday at 3AM CST, or manually

### Third-party dependency versions ([workflows/dependency-version](workflows/dependency-version.yaml))

*Enforces coherence of minimum supported dependencies*

Ensures that the minimum dependency versions found in the various CMake files match the values in `docker/dependencies.versions` used to build the containers. This ensures we synchronize versions across containers and workflows.

**when**: on pull request to the master branch when a CMake file or docker/dependencies.versions is changed, or manually

### ABI breaks with libabigail ([workflows/libabigail](workflows/libabigail.yaml))

*Checks for ABI breaks between a pull request and the latest release of Dyninst*

This runs libabigail's `abidiff` utility to compare the current changes against the last release. Only removed or modified functions in public interfaces are reported. The check is not run if the pull request is already marked as an ABI-breaking change.

**when**: on pull request to the master branch when source code changes, or manually

### Pull request checks ([workflows/pr-tests](workflows/pr-tests.yaml))

*Runs battery of tests on every pull request that changes source code*

This builds Dyninst, the test suite, and examples, and builds and runs the external and unit tests.

Each step except building the test suite uses all supported OSes and their default versions of gcc and clang. The test suite only builds with gcc. GitHub CI does not allow using ptrace, so it's not possible to execute the test suite.

**when**: on pull request to the master branch when source code changes, or manually

### Spack build ([workflows/spack-build](workflows/spack-build.yaml))

*Builds Dyninst using spack*

This checks that Dyninst builds with the latest version of spack using the default compiler
on the most-recent version of each supported OS.

**when**: Every Sunday at 3AM CST, or manually

### Parse system libraries ([workflows/system-libs](workflows/system-libs.yaml))

*Parses system libaries with ParseAPI*

This runs [simpleParser](https://github.com/dyninst/external-tests/blob/master/parseAPI/simpleParser.cpp) from the external-tests repository on every shared library in `/lib{64}` in the container for each supported operating system.

**when**: Every Monday at 1AM CST, or manually

### Purge old workflow runs ([workflows/purge-workflows](workflows/purge-workflows.yaml))

*Removes unneeded results from prior workflow runs*

GitHub doesn't provide a retention policy for workflow runs, so we purge them once per month. This is not strictly necessary because open-source projects do not have file system usage limits. However, it's nice to have the workflow tab uncluttered. All runs more than two weeks old are removed, and only the most-recent run in the last two weeks is retained.

**when**: The 1st of every month, or manually


## Container maintenance

Many different containers (aka packages) are used for both testing and conveniences for users. These require periodic updating to ensure they stay current with both the changes in Dyninst as well as the underlying Linux distribution.

Currently, only AMD64 packages are provided.

A *development* container is an environment built atop the corresponding base container with both the latest Dyninst source code and an installation of it located in /dyninst/src and /dyninst/install, respectively. The installation is built using the distribution's default version of gcc. Uses docker/Dockerfile to build and deploy the images.

A *base* container is an environment with the distribution's default versions of gcc, clang, git, cmake, static glibc, and all of Dyninst's dependencies installed. A python interpreter is purposefully not installed to reduce image size. It uses the respective `Dockerfile.<OS>` under the docker directory to build the images.

When the version of a dependency provided by the distribution is older than the version in docker/dependencies.versions, then it is necessary to build that dependency from source. See 'docker/Dockerfile.ubuntu' for an example.

**Refresh base and development containers** ([workflows/refresh-containers](workflows/refresh-containers.yaml))

*Refreshes containers for all supported operating systems*

Linux distributions periodically update their public containers- even the ones for a fixed version. It's a good idea to track these changes for the Dyninst packages, so this job is used to automatically account for this. The steps are

1. Purge all but the most-recent base and development containers
  - GitHub doesn't provide a retention policy for packages, so we purge them once per month. The development containers are built every time a pull request is merged, but only the most recent one is really of any use since the previous ones contain outdated code. Only tagged containers such as 'latest' or 'v13.0.0' are kept.
3. Build and deploy the base containers using the latest distro images
4. Build and deploy the development containers

With this sequence, we are guaranteed to have two versions of the base containers based on the most-recent two versions of the distro images (e.g., Ubuntu-24.04 from January and February). This isn't strictly necessary, but it might be useful for debugging purposes. The latest development containers are always based on the latest base containers.

Github scheduled jobs use cron which doesn't allow specifying 'the last Wednesday of the month', so the job runs on the 25th. Except for February, that should always be on a weekday in the last week of the month. The exact timing isn't critical because the old images aren't used in any of the workflows, but it should happen at a time when any failures can be detected and handled quickly.

**when**: 25th of every month.

**Build and deploy release containers** ([workflows/release-containers](workflows/release-containers.yaml))

*Builds and deploys release containers for all supported operating systems*

These are development containers with a fixed version of Dyninst.

Currently, this is only set up to be run manually. In the future, it can be run [automatically](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#release) when a release is created in GitHub.

# Updating workflows

## Adding a new OS version

1. Add it to the `names` array in the OS [action](actions/os-versions/action.yaml). If it's newer than the rest, then update the `names` array in the `latest` step.

2. Add another entry to the `configs` dictionary in the config [script](scripts/compiler_configs.py) following the existing naming convention. There are several workflows that check for names of the format `<OS>-<version>`.

3. Create a new base and dev container. For example to add ubuntu-X,

```
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.ubuntu
             -t ghcr.io/dyninst/amd64/ubuntu-X-base:latest
             --build-arg build_jobs=2
             --build-arg version=X
             $PWD

docker push ghcr.io/dyninst/amd64/ubuntu-X-base:latest

docker build -f docker/Dockerfile
             -t ghcr.io/dyninst/amd64/ubuntu-X:latest
             --build-arg base=ghcr.io/dyninst/amd64/ubuntu-X-base:latest
             --build-arg build_jobs=2
             $PWD

docker push ghcr.io/dyninst/amd64/ubuntu-X:latest
```

5. Follow the GitHub [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/connecting-a-repository-to-a-package#connecting-a-repository-to-an-organization-scoped-package-on-github) to add each container image to the Dyninst repository. The Dyninst user will need admin privileges to update and deploy containers from GitHub actions.

## Adding a new compiler version

If the compiler is available in a known OS version, then append the new version to the list of known ones in the config [script](scripts/compiler_configs.py). If the compiler is only available on an OS version that is not in the script, then add the new OS version and put the new compiler version there.

# Overview of GitHub CI features

## Using actions

Github [actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are a collection of steps that can either be run on their own or inserted into another workflow or action. Any outputs can then be referenced by subsequent steps in the same job. For example,

**actions/hello/action.yaml**

```
name: Say hello!
inputs:
  name:
    required: true
outputs:
  hello-string:
    value: ${{ steps.say.outputs.an_arbitrary_string }}
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - id: say
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo an_arbitrary_string="Hello, ${{ inputs.name }}!" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

**workflows/hello.yaml**

```
name: Hello

on:
  pull_request:
     branches:
        - master

jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - id: hello
        uses: ./.github/actions/hello
        with:
          name: "Bob"
      - run: |
          echo ${{ steps.hello.outputs.hello-string }}
```

## Using workflows

Workflows are similar to actions, but return their values (if any) via artifacts rather than as
values in $GITHUB_OUTPUT. See the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) for details.

### Matrix strategy

The workflows here make extensive use of the matrix [strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs) to generate multiple jobs. It is important to note that the inputs to a matrix must either be literals or come from the output of another job.

The `say-hello` job from the `hello` workflow above can be modified to address multiple names.

```
jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        name: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - id: hello
        uses: ./.github/actions/hello
        with:
          name: ${{ matrix.name }}
      - run: |
          echo ${{ steps.hello.outputs.hello-string }}
```

This will generate three jobs, each printing one name.


When multiple features are provided to a matrix, it creates jobs spanning the Cartesian product of the values. The below builds Dyninst using the latest version of each supported OS and each build type. Currently, this creates six jobs (e.g., os='fedora-39', bt='RELEASE').

```
jobs:

  get-build-types:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      all:  ${{ steps.build-type.outputs.all }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Dyninst
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - id: build-type
        uses: ./.github/actions/build-types

  get-oses:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      latest: ${{ steps.all.outputs.latest }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - id: all
        uses: ./.github/actions/os-versions

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [get-oses, get-build-types]
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: ${{ fromJson(needs.get-oses.outputs.latest) }}
        bt: ${{ fromJson(needs.get-build-types.outputs.all }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Dyninst
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Build Dyninst
      uses: ./.github/actions/build
      with:
        os: ${{ matrix.os }}
        compiler: "gcc"
        build-type: ${{ matrix.bt }}
```
