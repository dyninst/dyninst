API Reference - Type Interface
==============================

This section describes the type interface for the SymtabAPI library.
Currently this interface has the following capabilities:

-  Look up types within an object file.

-  Extend the types to create new types and add them to the Symtab file
   representation. These types will be available for lookup but will not
   be added if a new object file is produced.

The rest of the section describes the classes that are part of the type
interface.
