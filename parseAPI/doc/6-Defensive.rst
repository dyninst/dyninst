\section{Defensive Mode Parsing}
\label{sec:defmode}

Binary code that defends itself against analysis may violate the
assumptions made by the the ParseAPI's standard parsing algorithm.
Enabling defensive mode parsing activates more conservative
assumptions that substantially reduce the percentage of code that is
analyzed by the ParseAPI.  For this reason, defensive mode parsing is
best-suited for use of ParseAPI in conjunction with dynamic analysis
techniques that can compensate for its limited coverage of the binary
code.
