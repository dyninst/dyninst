\section{Abstractions}
\label{sec:abstractions}

DataflowAPI starts from the control flow graphs generated by ParseAPI and the instructions generated by InstructionAPI.
From these, it provides dataflow facts in a variety of forms. The key abstractions used by DataflowAPI are:

\begin{itemize}
\item[Abstract Location] Represents a register or memory location (cite)
\item[Abstract Region] Represents a set of abstract locations (cite)
\item[Semantics Policy] Provides callbacks for each low-level operation an instruction may perform.
\item[Assignment] Represents a single data dependency in an instruction. For example, xchg eax, ebx creates two assignments: one from pre-instruction eax to post-instruction ebx, and one from pre-instruction ebx to post-instruction eax.
\item[Stack Height] Represents the difference between a value in an abstract location and the stack pointer at a function's call site.
\item[AST] Represents the symbolic expansion of an instruction's full semantics
\item[Graph] Represents a directed graph.
\item[Symbolic Evaluator] Translates a graph representing a program slice (cite) into a mapping from assignments to ASTs.
\end{itemize}
