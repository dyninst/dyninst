\label{sec:intro}

DataFlowAPI aggregates a collection of dataflow analysis algorithms that are useful in Dyninst development into a single library. Currently, these algorithms include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Slicing
\item Stack Analysis
\item Instruction Semantics
\item Symbolic Expansion and Evaluation
\item Register Liveness
\end{itemize}
