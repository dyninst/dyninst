 *  do_something();
 *  std::cerr <<"that took " <<stopwatch.stop() <<" seconds.\n";
 * @endcode
 *
 *  All times are returned as floating point number of seconds.  The underlying
 * data structure has nanosecond resolution
 *  although accuracy is probably nowhere near that.
 *
 *  A stopwatch can be started and stopped as often as desired and it will
 * accumulate the total amount of time it has been in
 *  the running state (the clear() method resets the stopwatch by stopping it
 * and zeroing the total).  Starting an already
 *  running stopwatch does nothing, and neither does stopping an already stopped
 * stopwatch.
 *
 *  When a stopwatch is copied the destination stopwatch inherits the
 * accumulated time and running state of the source. Both
 *  instances are then completely independent of one another.
 *
 *  Thread safety: These functions are not thread-safe, although multiple
 * threads can invoke the methods concurrently on
 *  different objects.  It is permissible for different threads to invoke
 * methods on the same object provided that
 *  synchronization occurs above the method calls. */
