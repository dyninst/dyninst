/** Reads a line of text from a stream.
 *
 *  This function reads an entire line from @p stream, storing the text
 * (including the newline and a terminating null
 *  character) in a buffer and storing the buffer address in @p lineptr.  This
 * documentation is copied from the GNU source
 *  code with a few formatting modifications and name changes. The original GNU
 * getline() function is reportedly not available
 *  on Mac OSX v10.6 (Snow Leopard) for licensing reasons, so we provide our own
 * implementation.
 *
 *  Before calling rose_getline(), you should place in @p lineptr the address of
 * a buffer @p n bytes long, allocated with
 *  malloc().  If this buffer is long enough to hold the line, rose_getline()
 * stores the line in this buffer.  Otherwise,
 *  rose_getline() makes the buffer bigger using realloc(), storing the new
 * buffer address back in @p lineptr and the
 *  increased size back in @p n.
 *
 *  If you set @p lineptr to a null pointer, and @p n to zero, before the call,
 * then rose_getline() allocates the initial
 *  buffer for you by calling malloc().
 *
 *  In either case, when rose_getline() returns, @p lineptr points to the text
 * of the line.
 *
 *  When rose_getline() is successful, it returns the number of characters read
 * (including the newline, but not including the
 *  terminating null).  This value enables you to distinguish null characters
 * that are part of the line from the null
 *  character inserted as a terminator.
 *
 *  This is the recommended way to read lines from a stream.  The alternative
 * standard functions are unreliable.
 *
 *  If an error occurs or end of file is reached without any bytes read,
 * getline() returns -1. */
