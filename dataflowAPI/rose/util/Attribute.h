/** Attributes attached to other objects.
 *
 *  This namespace defines a mechanism for extending objects at run-time through
 * the use of name/value pairs called
 *  "attributes".  Attributes are an extension mechanism orthogonal to class
 * derivation and compile-time containment. Among
 *  other things, they are a convenient mechanism for users to cache data that
 * needs to be associated with some other
 *  object. There are two steps to using attributes: registering an attribute
 * name to obtain an ID number, and accessing
 *  attribute values stored in objects.
 *
 *
 *
 *  @section attribute_declaring Registering attribute names
 *
 *  In order to be able to store many attribute name/value pairs per object, the
 * attribute names must be declared by
 *  registering them with the library.  The names are entered into a global
 * symbol table and must be unique. Each name will be
 *  given an ID number to use when values are stored and retrieved.
 *
 *  @snippet attribute.C setup
 *  @snippet attribute.C declaring
 *
 *  Once an ID number is created it will never be removed from the attribute
 * symbol table; attribute ID numbers are stable
 *  for the life of the program.  If the same name is registered more than once
 * then an @ref Attribute::AlreadyExists exception
 *  is thrown.  The @ref Attribute::id and @ref Attribute::name functions can be
 * used to obtain the ID number for a name, or
 *  the name for an ID number, respectively.
 *
 *
 *
 *  @section attribute_using Storing and retrieving attributes
 *
 *  Each object can store zero or one value per declared attribute, and those
 * values can be any type. Since the attribute
 *  retrieval must use the exact same type, some care must be taken to ensure
 * that the correct type is stored. E.g., be sure to
 *  construct <code>std::string</code> if you're passing a string literal and
 * expect to read an <code>std::string</code> value
 *  back later, otherwise the attribute value will be of type <code>const
 * char*</code>.
 *
 *  @snippet attribute.C storing values
 *
 *  Since storing a value that can be interpreted as Boolean false is different
 * than storing no value at all, the API has an
 *  @ref Storage::attributeExists "attributeExists" method that can be used to
 * conditionally retrieve the value. If one calls
 *  @ref Storage::getAttribute "getAttribute" for an attribute that has not been
 * stored in the object, then a @ref DoesNotExist
 *  exception is thrown.  If the attribute exists but the type parameter differs
 * from the type of value that was stored, then a
 *  @ref WrongQueryType exception is thrown.
 *
 *  @snippet attribute.C retrieve with getAttribute
 *
 *  The @ref Storage::getAttribute "getAttribute" method of retrieval can be a
 * bit cumbersome since one has to check for
 *  existence first, so the API has additional methods that provide a default
 * value. The default value is either specified as
 *  an argument, or instantiated with a default constructor.
 *
 *  @snippet attribute.C retrieve with default
 *
 *  It's also possible to get a @ref Sawyer::Optional value, an object that
 * stores either the attribute value or nothing.  One
 *  of the useful things with this approach is being able to check for existence
 * and assign to a variable at the same time even
 *  if the attribute value could be interpreted as false:
 *
 *  @snippet attribute.C retrieve optional
 *
 *  Attributes can be erased from an object. Erasing an attribute value has no
 * effect on which attribute ID numbers are
 *  registered in the global attribute symbol table.
 *
 *  @snippet attribute.C erasing
 *
 *
 *
 *  @section attribute_providing Providing attribute storage capability
 *
 *  Providing the ability to store attributes in your own classes is easy: just
 * inherit from @ref Attribute::Storage. For a
 *  class hierarchy, only the base class should directly inherit from @ref
 * Attribute::Storage.
 *
 *  @snippet attribute.C providing
 *
 *  When such an object is assigned or copy-constructed the attribute values are
 * copied using their assignment or copy
 *  constructors. When an object is deleted, its attribute values are also
 * deleted. */
