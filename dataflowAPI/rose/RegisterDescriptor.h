/** Describes (part of) a physical CPU register.
 *
 *  Some architectures have multiple names for physical registers. For example,
 * a amd64 has a 64-bit integer register, parts
 *  of which are referred to as "rax", "eax", "ax", "al", and "ah".  The purpose
 * of a RegisterDescriptor is to describe what
 *  physical register (major and minor) is being referenced, and the part
 * (offset and nbits) that's being referenced.
 *
 *  The reason for having a major and minor number to specify a register is to
 * allow for different types of registers. For
 *  instance, an i686 has a set of 64-bit integer registers and a set of 80-bit
 * floating point registers (among others).
 *  Having major and minor numbers allows the physical register set (such as
 * defined by an instruction semantics policy) to
 *  be implemented as an array of 64-bit integers and an array of 80-bit
 * floating points (among others). The array is selected
 *  by the major number while the element of the array is selected by the minor
 * number.
 *
 *  The RegisterDescriptor type is part of a SgAsmRegisterReferenceExpression
 * and also appears in the register dictionaries
 *  (RegisterDictionary) used in various places including the disassembler. */
