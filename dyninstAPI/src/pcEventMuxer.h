/*
 * Overall design comment
 *
 * ProcControl events have two items of interest: the event type (which tells us
 * what happened)
 * and the event process (which tells us who it happened to). ProcControl
 * internally muxes a
 * callback based on the type, as you can register a different callback for each
 * event type.
 * However, it does not mux based on process. Therefore, we have to do the
 * muxing here in a
 * multiprocess situation.
 *
 * To make matters worse, we want to handle some events internally, without
 * waiting for
 * the user to explicitly wait() for an event. For example, traps corresponding
 * to
 * tramp jumps; such traps should be handled as quickly as possible.
 *
 * This leads to the following design:
 *
 * pcEventMuxer - unique class (static and globally accessible).
 *   - Registers callbacks with ProcControl
 *   - Contains a list of all active pcEventHandlers
 *   - Loops in ProcControl::wait(), waiting for events to be received
 *   - When an event is received, decode and determine if it is "fast" or "slow"
 *   - Fast events are handled immediately
 *   - Slow events are entered on a queue to be handled when the user calls
 *     pcEventMuxer::wait.
 * pcEventHandler - one per active process and a friend of pcProcess
 *   - Is called by pcEventMuxer to handle fast and slow process events.
 *
 * So the flow of events is twofold:
 *   pcEM::main() -> wait() -> decode() -> handle (fast) or enqueue (slow)
 *   pcEH::wait -> dequeue -> handle
 *

  /*
   * SYSCALL HANDLING
   *
   * The logic for handling system call entry/exit is complicated by the
   * fact that ProcControlAPI doesn't provide events for all system call
   * entry/exit events we are interested in on all platforms (it doesn't
   * provide them due to lacking OS debug interfaces). Additionally,
   * for some events we need to alert ProcControl that they have occurred
   * to allow it to update its Process/Thread structures (e.g., Post-Fork
   * on FreeBSD).
   *
   * The following approach is used to manage this situation in a
   * sane, clean way.
   *
   * There are two events that are used to indicate syscall entry/exit:
   * 1) A Dyninst breakpoint via the RT library
   * 2) A ProcControlAPI event for the syscall
   *
   * There are three cases we need to handle related to these events:
   * case 1: Event 2 is provided by ProcControl -> 1 is not necessary,
   * the BPatch-level event is reported when 2 is received.
   *
   * case 2: Event 2 is not provided by ProcControl -> 1 is necessary,
   * 2 is reported to ProcControl at 1, the BPatch-level event is
   * reported when 2 is received via ProcControl (after it updates its
   * internal data structures)
   *
   * case 3: Event 2 is not provided by ProcControl -> 1 is necessary,
   * the BPatch-level event is reported at 1
   *
   * These cases translate to the following in terms of registering
   * ProcControlAPI callbacks and inserting breakpoints via the
   * syscallNotification class.
   *
   * case 1: register the callback, don't insert the breakpoint
   * case 2: register the callback, insert the breakpoint
   * case 3: don't register the callback, insert the breakpoint
