// Infrastructure for the code generating Widgets; try to automate
// as much of the handling as we can.
//
// Background
//  An Widget can generate two types of code: PIC and non-PIC. PIC code can be
//  treated
//  as a sequence of bytes that can be freely copied around, whereas non-PIC
//  code must
//  be tweaked whenever its address changes as part of code generation. Note, it
//  is safe
//  treat PIC code as non-PIC (though less than optimal); the reverse is not
//  true. For
//  efficiency we want to bundle PIC code together and avoid re-generating it in
//  every pass,
//  while keeping callbacks for non-PIC code.
//
//  Another requirement of this system is to build a tracking data structure
//  that maps from
//  address in the generated code to who generated that code, so we can maintain
//  a mapping
//  between original addresses and moved (relocated) code. We also wish to do
//  this automatically.
//
//  Thus, we provide an interface that automates these two functions as much as
//  possible. We provide
//  two ways of specifying code: copy and patch. Copy handles PIC code, and
//  pulls in a buffer of bytes
//  (e.g., memcpy). Patch registers a callback for later that will provide some
//  code.
//
//  With these two methods the user can specify a tracking data structure that
//  specifies what kind
//  of code they have provided.

// The input grammar to the CodeBuffer is [PIC|nonPIC]*. However, it is safe to
// accumulate
// between adjacent PICs, so we can simplify this to ((PIC*)nonPIC)*. This
// drives our internal
// storage, which is a list of (buffer, patch) pairs; the buffer contains (PIC*)
// and the
// patch represents a nonPIC entry. For each pair, we also associate a list of
// code trackers,
// since there is a 1:1 relationship between each element (PIC, nonPIC) and a
// tracker.
