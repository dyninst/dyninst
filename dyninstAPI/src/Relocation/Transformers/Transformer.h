// One of the things a Transformer 'returns' (modifies, really) is

// Suggested, and Not Required. Required means we have proof
// that a patch is necessary for correct control flow. Suggested means
// that, assuming correct parsing, no patch is necessary. Not Required
// means that even with incorrect parsing no patch is necessary.
// ... not sure how we can have that, but hey, we might as well
// design it in.
//
// OffLimits indicates areas that we cannot overwrite with a branch
