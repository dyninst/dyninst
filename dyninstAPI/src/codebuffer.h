// This class serves as a flexible buffer target for code generation.
// We support two methods of writing: either copying data into the
// buffer via codebuf methods or accessing a pointer and data copying
// externally.
// The second is ugly but works well as a legacy method.

// However, neither handles the problem of generating code that has variable
// size.
// We want to be efficient in handling PIC code (which can just be moved), and
// an awful
// lot of what we do is PIC. However, we need to handle patching mechanisms,
// both when
// the size of the patch is known (e.g., easy) and unknown (e.g., hard). We do
// this by
// creating a list of alternating PIC code buffers (possibly annotated with
// fixed-size
// patches) and non-fixed code generating patches.
//
// Thus an index is actually a pair that identifies which internal code buffer
// to use
// and where in that code buffer we want.
//
// Finally, we have a huge pile of interface methods that completely hide this
// from our
// users. We do have one big restriction: you cannot put in any references
// (e.g., branch
// targets) across a variable-size patch.
