Dyninst is a collection of libraries for performing binary instrumentation, analysis, and
modification. These libraries are assembled into a collection of toolkits that allow users
to more effectively use different aspects of binary analysis for building their own tools.

:ref:`sec:dyncapi-intro`
  A C-like language for enabling rapid creation of Dyninst mutators without the need to specify API-level
  interactions.

:ref:`sec:dyninstapi-intro`
   An interface for instrumenting and working with binaries and processes

:ref:`sec:instruction-intro`
   Decode raw binary instructions into a platform-independent represention that provides
   a description of their semantics

:ref:`sec:parseapi-intro`
   Converts the machine code representation of a program, library, or code snippet into
   platform-independent abstractions such as instructions, basic blocks, functions, and loops

:ref:`sec-patchapi-intro`
   Instrument (insert code into) and modify a binary executable or library by manipulating
   the binaryâ€™s control flow graph (CFG)

:ref:`sec:proccontrolapi-intro`
   An API and library for controlling processes
