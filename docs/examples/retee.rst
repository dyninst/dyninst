retee
=====

The final example is a program called "re-tee." It takes three
arguments: the pathname of an executable program, the process id of a
running instance of the same program, and a file name. It adds code to
the running program that copies to the named file all output that the
program writes to its standard output file descriptor. In this way it
works like "tee," which passes output along to its own standard out
while also saving it in a file. The motivation for the example program
is that you run a program, and it starts to print copious lines of
output to your screen, and you wish to save that output in a file
without having to re-run the program.

    * retee.C
    *
    * This program (mutator) provides an example of several facets of
    * Dyninst's behavior, and is a good basis for many Dyninst
    * mutators. We want to intercept all output from a target application
    * (the mutatee), duplicating output to a file as well as the
    * original destination (e.g., stdout).
    *
    * This mutator operates in several phases. In brief:
    * 1) Attach to the running process and get a handle (BPatch_process
    * object)
    * 2) Get a handle for the parsed image of the mutatee for function
    * lookup (BPatch_image object)
    * 3) Open a file for output
    * 3a) Look up the "open" function
    * 3b) Build a code snippet to call open with the file name.
    * 3c) Run that code snippet via a oneTimeCode, saving the returned
    * file descriptor
    * 4) Write the returned file descriptor into a memory variable for
    * mutatee-side use
    * 5) Build a snippet that copies output to the file
    * 5a) Locate the "write" library call
    * 5b) Access its parameters
    * 5c) Build a snippet calling write(fd, parameters)
    * 5d) Insert the snippet at write
    * 6) Add a hook to exit to ensure that we close the file (using
    * a callback at exit and another oneTimeCode)
