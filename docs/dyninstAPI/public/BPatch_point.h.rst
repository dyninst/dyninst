``BPatch_point``
----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_point

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_point
   
   An object of this class represents a location in an application’s code
   at which the library can insert instrumentation. A BPatch_image object
   (see section 4.10) is used to retrieve a BPatch_point representing a
   desired point in the application.
   
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_procedureLocation
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_entry
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_exit
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_subroutine
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_address
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_procedureLocation getPointType()
      
      Return the type of the point.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *getCalledFunction()
      
      Return a BPatch_function representing the function that is called at the
      point. If the point is not a function call site or the target of the
      call cannot be determined, then this function returns NULL.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::string getCalledFunctionName()
      
      Returns the name of the function called at this point. This method is
      similar to getCal-ledFunction()->getName(), except in cases where
      DyninstAPI is running in binary rewrit­ing mode and the called function
      resides in a library or object file that DyninstAPI has not opened. In
      these cases, Dyninst is able to determine the name of the called
      function, but is unable to construct a BPatch_function object.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *getFunction()
      
      Returns a BPatch_function representing the function in which this point
      is contained.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_basicBlockLoop *getLoop()
      
      Returns the containing BPatch_basicBlockLoop if this point is part of
      loop instrumentation. Returns NULL otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *getAddress()
      
      Return the address of the first instruction at this point.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool usesTrap_NP()
      
      Return true if inserting instrumentation at this point requires using a
      trap. On the x86 architecture, because instructions are of variable
      size, the instruction at a point may be too small for Dyninst to replace
      it with the normal code sequence used to call instrumentation. Also,
      when instrumentation is placed at points other than subroutine entry,
      exit, or call points, traps may be used to ensure the instrumentation
      fits. In this case, Dyninst replaces the instruction with a single-byte
      instruction that generates a trap. A trap handler then calls the
      appropriate instrumentation code. Since this technique is used only on
      some platforms, on other platforms this function always returns false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: const BPatch_memoryAccess* getMemoryAccess()
      
      Returns the memory access object associated with this point. Memory
      access points are described in section 4.27.1.
      
   .. cpp:function:: const std::vector<BPatchSnippetHandle *> getCurrentSnippets()
      
   .. cpp:function:: const std::vector<BPatchSnippetHandle *> getCurrentSnippets(BPatch_callWhen when)
      
      Return the BPatchSnippetHandles for the BPatch_snippets that are
      associated with the point. If argument when is BPatch_callBefore, then
      BPatchSnippetHandles for snippets installed immediately before this
      point will be returned. Alternatively, if when is BPatch_callAfter, then
      BPatchSnippetHandles for snippets installed immediately after this point
      will be returned.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getLiveRegisters(std::vector<BPatch_register> &regs)
      
      Fill regs with the registers that are live before this point (e.g.,
      BPatch_callBefore). Currently returns only general purpose registers
      (GPRs).
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isDynamic()
      
      This call returns true if this is a dynamic call site (e.g. a call site
      where the function call is made via a function pointer).
      
   .. cpp:function:: void* monitorCalls(BPatch_function* func)
      
      For a dynamic call site, this call instruments the call site represented
      by this instrumentation point with a function call. If input parameter
      func is not NULL, func is called at the call site as the
      instrumentation. If func is NULL, the callback function registered with
      BPatch::registerDynamicCallCallback is used for instrumentation. Under
      both cases, this call returns a pointer to the called function. If the
      instrumentation point does not represent a dynamic call site, this call
      returns NULL.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool stopMonitoring()
      
      This call returns true if this instrumentation point is a dynamic call
      site and its instrumentation is successfully removed. Otherwise, it
      returns false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: Dyninst::InstructionAPI::Instruction::Ptr getInstructionAtPoint()
      
      On implemented platforms, this function returns a shared pointer to an
      InstructionAPI Instruction object representing the first machine
      instruction at this point’s address. On unimplemented platforms, returns
      a NULL shared pointer.
