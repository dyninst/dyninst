``BPatch_thread``
-----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_thread

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_thread
   
   The **BPatch_thread** class represents and controls a thread of
   execution that is running in a process.
   
   .. cpp:function:: void getCallStack(std::vector<BPatch_frame>& stack)
      
      This function fills the given vector with current information about the
      call stack of the thread. Each stack frame is represented by a
      BPatch_frame (see section 4.24 for information about this class).
      
   .. cpp:function:: dynthread_t getTid()
      
      This function returns a platform-specific identifier for this thread.
      This is the identifier that is used by the threading library. For
      example, on pthread applications this function will return the thread’s
      pthread_t value.
      
   .. cpp:function:: Dyninst::LWP getLWP()
      
      This function returns a platform-specific identifier that the operating
      system uses to identify this thread. For example, on UNIX platforms this
      returns the LWP id. On Windows this returns a HANDLE object for the
      thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned getBPatchID()
      
      This function returns a Dyninst-specific identifier for this thread.
      These ID’s apply only to running threads, the BPatch ID of an already
      terminated thread my be repeated in a new thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *getInitialFunc()
      
      Return the function that was used by the application to start this
      thread. For example, on pthread applications this will return the
      initial function that was passed to pthread_create.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned long getStackTopAddr()
      
      Returns the base address for this thread’s stack.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isDeadOnArrival()
      
      This function returns true if this thread terminated execution before
      Dyninst was able to attach to it. Since Dyninst performs new thread
      detection asynchronously, it is possible for a thread to be created and
      destroyed before Dyninst can attach to it. When this happens, a new
      BPatch_thread is created, but isDeadOnArrival always returns true for
      this thread. It is illegal to perform any thread-level operations on a
      dead on arrival thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_process *getProcess()
      
      Return the BPatch_process that contains this thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *oneTimeCode(const BPatch_snippet &expr, bool *err = NULL)
      
      Cause the snippet expr to be evaluated by the process immediately. This
      is similar to the BPatch_process::oneTimeCode function, except that the
      snippet is guaranteed to run only on this thread. The process must be
      stopped to call this function. The behavior is synchronous; oneTimeCode
      will not return until after the snippet has been run in the application.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool oneTimeCodeAsync(const BPatch_snippet &expr, \
         void *userData = NULL, \
         BpatchOneTimeCodeCallback cb = NULL)
      
      This function sets up the snippet expr to be evaluated by this thread at
      the next available opportunity. When the snippet finishes running,
      Dyninst will callback any function registered through
      BPatch::registerOneTimeCodeCallback, with userData passed as a
      parameter. This function returns true if expr was posted or false
      otherwise.
      
      This is similar to the BPatch_process::oneTimeCodeAsync function, except
      that the snippet is guaranteed to run only on this thread. The process
      must be stopped to call this function. The behavior is asynchronous;
      oneTimeCodeAsync returns before the snippet is executed.
