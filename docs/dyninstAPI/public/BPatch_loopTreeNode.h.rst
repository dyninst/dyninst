``BPatch_loopTreeNode``
-----------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_loopTreeNode

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_loopTreeNode
   
   The **BPatch_loopTreeNode** class provides a tree interface to a
   collection of instances of class BPatch_basicBlockLoop contained in a
   BPatch_flowGraph. The structure of the tree follows the nesting
   relationship of the loops in a function’s flow graph. Each
   BPatch_­loopTreeNode contains a pointer to a loop (represented by
   BPatch_basicBlockLoop), and a set of sub-loops (represented by other
   BPatch_loopTreeNode objects). The root BPatch_­loopTreeNode instance has
   a null loop member since a function may contain multiple outer loops.
   The outer loops are contained in the root instance’s vector of children.
   
   Each instance of BPatch_loopTreeNode is given a name that indicates its
   position in the hierarchy of loops. The name of each root loop takes the
   form of loop_x, where x is an integer from 1 to n, where n is the number
   of outer loops in the function. Each sub-loop has the name of its
   parent, followed by a .y, where y is 1 to m, where m is the number of
   sub-loops under the outer loop. For example, consider the following C
   function:
   
   .. code-block:: cpp
   
      void foo() {
         int x, y, z, i;
         
         for (x=0; x<10; x++) {
            for (y = 0; y<10; y++)
            ...
            for (z = 0; z<10; z++)
            ...
         }
         for (i = 0; i<10; i++) {
         ...
         }
      }
   
   The foo function will have a root BPatch_loopTreeNode, containing a NULL
   loop entry and two BPatch_loopTreeNode children representing the
   functions outer loops. These children would have names loop_1 and
   loop_2, respectively representing the x and i loops. loop_2 has no
   children. loop_1 has two child BPatch_loopTreeNode objects, named
   loop_1.1 and loop_1.2, respectively representing the y and z loops.
   
   .. cpp:var:: BPatch_basicBlockLoop *loop
   
   A node in the tree that represents a single BPatch_basicBlockLoop
   instance.
   
   .. cpp:var:: std::vector<BPatch_loopTreeNode *> children
   
   The tree nodes for the loops nested under this loop.
   
   .. cpp:function:: const char *name()
      
      Return a name for this loop that indicates its position in the hierarchy
      of loops.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getCallees(std::vector<BPatch_function *> &v, BPatch_addressSpace*p)
      
      This function fills the vector v with the list of functions that are
      called by this loop.
      
   .. cpp:function:: const char *getCalleeName(unsigned int i)
      
      This function return the name of the i\ :sup:`th` function called in the
      loop’s body.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned int numCallees()
      
      Returns the number of callees contained in this loop’s body.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_basicBlockLoop *findLoop(const char *name)
      
      Finds the loop object for the given canonical loop name.
