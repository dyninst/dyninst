.. cpp:class:: ProcessReader

  **Read from a process' memory space**

  The implementation of the :cpp:class:`AddressLookup` on Linux requires it to be
  able to read from the target processâ€™s address space.

.. note:: The ``ProcessReader`` is defined, but not used, on non-Linux systems.

By default, reading from another process on the same system this is done through the
operating system debugger interface. A user can provide their own
process reading mechanism by implementing a child of the
``ProcessReader`` class and passing it to the :cpp:class:`AddressLookup` constructors.

  .. warning:: These functions should not be directly called by user code.

  .. cpp:function:: virtual bool ReadMem(Address traced, void *inSelf, unsigned size) = 0

    Reads ``size`` bytes from the address at ``traced`` into the buffer pointed to by ``inSelf``.

  .. cpp:function:: virtual bool GetReg(MachRegister reg, MachRegisterVal &val) = 0

    Reads from ``reg`` and places the result in ``val``.

  .. cpp:function::virtual bool start() = 0;
  .. cpp:function::virtual bool isAsync()
  .. cpp:function::virtual bool done() = 0
